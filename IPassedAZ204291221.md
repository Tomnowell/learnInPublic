# Introduction and tips for Microsoft AZ204 Developer Associate

## Hi, I'm Tom! I am an impostor.

A little bacTkground, because I hope people still read this in 2031 (do I really? :D). In 2020, a year remembered by lockdowns, limits and outright bans on socialising and fear of the waves of novel coronavirus sweeping around the globe. I was (and at the time of writing, still am) an English teacher in public schools. Apart from a two week hiatus in the spring of 2020, I have had to go to work and teach wonderful, talented, highly infectious students.

Don't get me wrong, I **love** my job. But, like many others 2020 (and 2021) has made me reconsider my own priorities. I'm a musician so I made a few 'stock music' tracks. You know, the kind you can use on YouTube viedos or business training videos. And, either I'm not very good, or there is not much money to be made in that field, or both. I applaud anyone who makes a living doing that. So, I came to computers.

I took some free MOOCs (massive open online course). Starting with [MIT's 6001x and 6002x](https://www.edx.org/xseries "MIT Learn Python courses on EDX")mitx-computational-thinking-using-python?index=product&queryID=db1bcd636946bf27af85354b46f389d5&position=3) Python programming introduction which was, and still is, a fantastic intro to programming. Then [CS50 from Harvard](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ "CS50 from Harvard"). Also free, and you can get a certificate, too. While doing the MIT course the course recommends practice on sites like [codewars](https://www.codewars.com "codewars") which I also recommend highly. It's addictive and...free! Perhaps you sense a theme. I don't have much money to spend on my education.

I also signed up for [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org "free code camp") and through the totally non spammy newsletter from the legendary Quincy Larson, founder of Freecodecamp, I discovered [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) podcast, which in turn, introduced me to the concept of "learning in public". In [episode 467](https://chtbl.com/track/A551A9/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/467/the-changelog-467.mp3 "podcast link"), Shawn "swyx" Wang talks about his journey to becoming a software developer and introduced me to the concept of learning in public. As a teacher, it resonated. I learned most of the implicit grammar of English that I know now by teaching it to students. There is nothing quite so solidifying for knowledge than to explain it to someone else. I guess the concept is introduced in CS50 (and is something of a folk tale in computer science) where students are encouraged to talk to a rubber duck when they have a problem. The reason being that you can logically explain every step and more systematically find errors. This really works, but wouldn't it be great if the duck could ask you questions, too?

So today, my first post. And my resolution to learn in public. At the end of 2021, the second full year of the Covid pandemic, I signed up to do the [Microsoft AZ204 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-204 "Microsoft AZ204 exam information") that, if successful would certify me to be a Microsoft Certified Azure Developer Associate. I was learning about cloud computing, though mostly AWS ([Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/ "amazon web services")) and thought it would be fun to work towards a certificate. The exams are rather expensive, but not prohibitively so. But, while researching costs and ways of taking the exam, I stumbled across Microsoft's certification. They were offering any exam to people affected by Covid (which is just about everyone, really) for $15 US. 'Wow!' I thought, 'that's cheaper than a practice exam', so I signed up.

That was back in September. I used Microsoft's own [learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/ "Microsoft Learn") materials to study for the exam. I studied and studied and studied. I definitely expected to fail the exam. I am not great at retaining information and I haven't taken an exam since I was 16 years old. The format was certainly different. And while I can't give any information about the questions on the exam. I can give a few hints to future takers.

-   Use a decent webcam. Photographing shiny IDs or passports is difficult in any situation. I had a really hard time and wasted 30 minutes trying to get a decent photo of my ID. It was stressful and wasteful. Most forms of ID are reflective and difficult to photograph especially with webcams which often have fixed focal lengths making it nearly impossible to take close up pictures. Maybe practice a little beforehand, too. You will be asked to take a photo with the webcam that you choose at the beginning of your test. You cannot use a phone.

-   Close any unnecessary processes on your computer. For some reason, my computer had Hyper-V running (virtualisation software) and while the exam software will shut down most of the processes for you, you may be required to manually stop some if they require Administrator privilege to stop. Also, I had random alerts that certain software was not allowed while taking the test, even though they were not running. I ignored them, and if you get them, I suggest you do too. Don't open Task Manager to see what's going on, because that is not allowed, also.

-   Don't make loud noises or talk to yourself. I coughed once and had a warning about talking during the test. I certainly wasn't talking, but just be aware that you could forfeit your exam if you're the kind of person to talk to rubber ducks while you're thinking.

Amazingly, luckily, and through every fault of my own, I passed the AZ204 exam! I was totally dumbfounded when I finished the test and I received my score.

So, now I continue my journey as a **Microsoft Certified Microsoft Azure Developer Associate**. I am an _impostor_, but I will impose a little longer and keep learning. If you'd like to participate, I would value your comments, advice and gentle humour on my journey. Feel free to join me as I get lost on the way to being a little wiser. Please be kind, I like to think I have thick skin, but I really don't know what I am talking about.

On that note, Happy New Year! See you in 11111100110!
